# tic-tac-toe

This is the second game I've created. <br>
I used Unity to develop this. <br>
Coding language is C#. I also make use of Unity's API. <br>

###Controls:
Click on spots to place your X or O there.

###Rules:
Basic tic tac toe.

###Files:
exit.cs - Exits the application if the player presses the button this script is attached to. <br>
gameplay.cs - Controls the gameplay of tic tac toe, checks if someone wins, places Xs and Os. <br>
playAgain.cs - Restarts the game if the player presses the button this script is attached to. <br>
title.cs - Sets and erases the title of the game when necessary.
